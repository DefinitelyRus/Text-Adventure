To start a game, a Game object has to be created, only needing to specify how many levels are to be played. The rest is handled automatically upon the creation of the Game object (inside __init__).

In a standard game of Marvelous Adventures, there are 100 scenes (known externally as "levels"). Each level is set in a specified location.

In each level, there are a list of enemies and a specified number of turns. Once the players run out of turns, the enemies will run away with limited or no rewards to the players. All 1st levels of each stage are scripted. All events in this level are premade. Every 6th and 19th level of a stage, there won't be any required combat events. Instead, the players will enter a shop where they can buy and/or sell items. Every 7th and 14th level of a stage, the enemy encounter will be a guaranteed mini-boss. Levels 2, 5, 9, 12, 16, and 18 are all guaranteed regular combat events. The rest of the levels are random. Could be a combat event, shop, etc. All 20th levels are guaranteed boss fights. Finishing this level will progress the game into the next scene.

In each turn, each player can perform an ExecutableAction by using a CombatCard. Essentially, a CombatCard is a preset ExecutableAction that can be used in combat.

Locations can provide special effects during gameplay. For example, an Arctic Tundra location will apply a freezing effect on all entities, including enemies. Certain entities are immune to its effects, some aren't. Those who are affected will need to prevent it by using certain CombatCards or items.
